# photoshop

A collection of photoshop scripts written for my Photoshop-using buddies.  I'm not a photoshop guy, but I'm told these are useful to some people.  

# INSTALL

If you're not a programmer, but just want to use these scripts in photoshop...

* in the above list of files click on the file you want
* click on the "Raw" button to see just the file (no github controls)
* right-click and select "Save as..." or go to the main menu and select "Save page as..." or hit Ctrl+s
* save the file in your photoshop scripts directory (usually "Presets/Scripts")
  * the file name is the command you see in the menu
